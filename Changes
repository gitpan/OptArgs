0.1.11_1 (2014-06-10)

    API Changes:
       - None.

    New Features:
       - None.

    Enhancements:
       - Put POD back into .pm files; metacpan looks odd when separate.

    Bug Fixes:
       - Depend on Encode version 2.24 which should allow OptArgs to
         work on old versions of Perl on *BSD. Closes
         https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=95888.
       - Generate Getopt::Args in Makefile.PL instead of in a Git
         commit hook which will work with the new release method.
         Closes https://github.com/mlawren/p5-OptArgs/issues/10.

        - None

    Enhancements:
        - None

    Bug Fixes:
        - Several "s/-/_/g" regex's were missing the final "g". Without
          the global replacement, sub commands that had more than one
          '-' in them would fail to be found during dispatch.  Closes
          https://github.com/mlawren/p5-OptArgs/issues/8.

          $OptArgs::SORT (Thanks to Robbin Bonthond)
        - (The above require a minor version number upgrade)

    Enhancements:
        - Document colourized output behaviour
        - Improved usage output: simpler colour scheme, more info
        - Improved tests

    Bug Fixes:
